Proposed stories:

	o- playerfisharray
	o- adding fish into array must be fair
	o- are they mirrored?	

- As a player I want a fish to be removed from the strip when I catch it
	o- remove from playerfisharray
	o- replace at end of turn phase when both players have caught

- As a player I want to win in a set time
	o- gametimer
	o- cue when low
	o- compare player scores at end	

- As a player I want to avoid jellyfish
	o- jellyfish react on collision and DO NOT require a playerinput.
	o- collision compare
	o- make sure to set linedown bools in playercontroler and trigger movement
	

- As a player I want to play an optimised game
	o- Object Pool
	o- Minimise instantiation and destroy
	o- correctly encoded sprites at relevant sizes
